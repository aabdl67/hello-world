# hello-world
This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow.

I am Abubakar Abdallah, a highly motivated and committed individual with strong background in Statistics (2022 BSc. Statistics graduate).
I have always been passionate about data, and aim to puruse a career that utilizes statistics and data to solve real-world problems.
I had been learning about data analtytics and its practical tools intermitently without a firm pathway for a long while until recently, when I noticed via LinkedIn a pattern on the requirements of data professional careers more specifically data analtyics and data science, and voilaaa, Here I am today!!!
Lastly, I have a strong aptitude for health promotion, volunteerism and community service.
